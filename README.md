# PhilosopherGuidance

#Purpose
This project,outside of the actual function of the website, is meant to serve two primary purposes
    1. Solidify HTML and CSS fundamentals
    2. Be the first version of a project that will eventually have more functionality (JavaScript, React, NodeJS,etc)

When it comes to the actual function of the website, the project is meant to be a simple UI that prompts the user to select a category/theme, the input of which will be used in later version in order to output "philosopher guidance" related to the category/theme. This version of the so-called PhilosopherGuidance project will primarly serve as a first step towards a more fleshed out web application, as described previously- focusing more on writing readable and accessible HTML and CSS. The UI for this version will also not focus so much on aesthetics as it will on minimum viable intelligibility to provide a good stepping stone for future improved versions of the PhilosopherGuidance project. The ultimate goal is to create a web application with a dynamic and aesthetically pleasing feel, as well as back-end functionality so as to be able to pull in data related to the category/theme that our users, which will certainly be thirsty for knowledge, picked as the category that they want our philosophers to give them guidance on.
