            <p>Have you ever felt lost in life? Or perhaps that's too broad an observation; perhaps you have felt lost in one particular aspect of life?</p>
            <p>If such an observation strikes you as something that applies to your Being, then there's no need to fret-ask for the guidance of humans,dead and current, that spend their day thinking about questions that don't have answers!</p>
            <p>Welcome to The PhilosopherGuidance Project. Select a category/theme that you feel most strongly applies to what you desire to learn more about, and let the magic unfold, as you receive guidance from one of humanity's most important thinkers!</p>
